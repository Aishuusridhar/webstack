    <h1>Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters</h1>
    <p>
        While in Camp Half-Blood, Percy Jackson recounts the story of Thalia and her sacrifice. A young Annabeth, Luke, Grover and Thalia are running to Camp Half-Blood while being pursued by monsters. Thalia sacrifices herself to get the others into the camp, and her father Zeus turns her into a tree which forms a barrier around it. After his quest for Zeus's bolt has faded in popularity, Percy is called a one-quest wonder by camp bully, Clarisse La Rue, but Annabeth and Grover support him.
